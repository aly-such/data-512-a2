### Bottom 10 countries by coverage: 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population
### Top 10 countries by relative quality: 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of the relative proportion of politician articles that are of GA and FA-quality
### Bottom 10 countries by relative quality: 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of the relative proportion of politician articles that are of GA and FA-quality
### Geographic regions by coverage: Ranking of geographic regions (in descending order) in terms of the total count of politician articles from countries in each region as a proportion of total regional population
### Geographic regions by coverage: Ranking of geographic regions (in descending order) in terms of the relative proportion of politician articles from countries in each region that are of GA and FA-quality
## Reflection:
## Questions:
### What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
### What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data processing and analysis?
### What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?
### What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
### Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?
### Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?
### How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
