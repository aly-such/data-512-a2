# A.2. Bias in Data
## Goal:
The goal of this assignment is to collect, curate, and analyze data on articles of politicians for many countries, then explore the biases that can be present in this analysis. We will collect article data from Wikipedia as well as population data from the Population Reference Bureau. We want to understand the coverage of politicians for different countries on Wikipedia as well as the quality of article for the politician. It is important to then discuss the biases that can pop within this analysis to better understand moving forward what we can do to alleviate and account for these biases.
## Data Sources:
*   Politicians by Country Dataset: https://figshare.com/articles/Untitled_Item/5513449
*   World Population Data Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CFJO2zna2No5KqNm9rPK5PCACoXKzb-nycJFhV689Iw/edit?usp=sharing
## Data Descriptions:
### wp_wpds_politicians_by_country.csv
### wp_wpds_countries-no_match.csv
## Notes:
## Charts:
### Top 10 countries by coverage: 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population
### Bottom 10 countries by coverage: 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population
### Top 10 countries by relative quality: 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of the relative proportion of politician articles that are of GA and FA-quality
### Bottom 10 countries by relative quality: 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of the relative proportion of politician articles that are of GA and FA-quality
### Geographic regions by coverage: Ranking of geographic regions (in descending order) in terms of the total count of politician articles from countries in each region as a proportion of total regional population
### Geographic regions by coverage: Ranking of geographic regions (in descending order) in terms of the relative proportion of politician articles from countries in each region that are of GA and FA-quality
## Reflection:
## Questions:
### What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
### What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data processing and analysis?
### What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?
### What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
### Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?
### Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?
### How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
